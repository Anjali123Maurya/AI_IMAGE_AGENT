# ðŸ§  AI Image Analysis Agent with TensorFlow and OpenCV

This project is an AI-powered research agent that analyzes images using deep learning. It uses the **MobileNetV2** pre-trained model to predict what's in an image and extracts the **dominant color** for further analysis. 


## ðŸ“Œ Features

-  Top-3 predictions using **MobileNetV2** (TensorFlow/Keras)
-  Dominant RGB color detection using **OpenCV**
-  Upload and analyze any image
-  Runs easily in **Google Colab** (no setup required)
